# hhh
========
The hierarchical heavy hitter (hhh) simulator code

This code was originally written by Thomas Steinke
(tsteinke@seas.harvard.edu) in 2010.
The code was modified by Kenjiro Cho (kjc@iijlab.net) in 2017 to
evaluate the recursive lattice search (rls) algorithm, and compare it
against the original hhh (space-saving) algorithm.
The RLS code was ported from agurim (https:/github.com/necoma/agurim).
The original hhh2 was extended to hhh2_1089 for bit-wise aggregation.
Only hhh2 hhh2_1089 rls2 rls2_1089 rls2_1089_swap were tested for this
modified simulator, on FreeBSD-10.  The original scripts were not used.

See "runme" file for the information about the original implementation.
